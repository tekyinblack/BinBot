This is the first version of the binbot code used primarily for demonstrations.
As it is, it runs as a line follower using the Cytron Makerline board, and will follow a line until either
one of the two ultrasonic sensor inputs detects an obstacle
If the lower sensor detects, the the robot stops and waits until clear. The ntention is to add a horn and potentially a
library of verbal warnings as well.
If the upper sensor is triggered, teh robot stops and opens the bin for ten seconds to allow a deposit and then
closes teh bin, and if there ar no further obstructions, continues line following.
